# Social-Network-API

This application is designed to mimic a Social Networking site, similar to Facebook, using a REST API and built with Express.js, Mongoose, Moment.js, and MongoDB. In order to use this application, ensure that MongoDB is first installed on your machine. Then install the necessary packages by opening up the Integraded Terminal and typing in "npm i express; npm i mongoose; npm i moment" and hit enter to begin the installation. Once the installation is complete open the Command Prompt on your machine and type in "mongod" to initiate MongoDB. With MongoDB running, in the Integrated Terminal type in "npm start" to spin up the server.

Now head into Insomnia Core and begin making the "GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE" calls to the API.
